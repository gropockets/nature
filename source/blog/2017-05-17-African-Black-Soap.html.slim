p Ancient remedies for skin and hair are becoming more mainstream as more people realize their conventional toiletries are full of damaging ingredients. Enter, African Black Soap. For centuries, regions in Africa (namely Ghana and Nigeria) have combined locally grown crops and age-old wisdom to perfect their recipes. There are actually hundreds of unique variations depending on the region and community, a lot like curry powders. The soaps all promise similar benefits: smooth, even complexions and lustrous hair.

  li Because of the natural ingredients, the contents may change consistencies or separate. Just stick them in the fridge for a bit and they will return to their intended state.

  li Some people can have a reaction from trying all-natural deodorants. A lot of time it's actually your body responding to the sudden halt of chemical laden products.

  li Some sweat is normal...and healthy! The options weâ€™ve selected all have natural ingredients to minimize moisture, but expect a little sweat especially depending on your activity level and climate.
