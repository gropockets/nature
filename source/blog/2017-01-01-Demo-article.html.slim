p This is a demo article. It shows the syntax to insert images, create links, make bold words and more.

p Let's start with a simple image.  The first parameter is the function name: "blog_img".  Next, you put the name of the image file (which must be in the "images" folder).  Finally, you put a description for the image.  This will appear as the "alt" attribute of the image in the final HTML.  It's important for SEO.  

= blog_img "compare-3-jar-deoderants-primal-pit-paste-naturally-sourced-schmidt's.jpg", "my alt attribute text"

h2 Links

p Another helpful feature is creating links.  You can do this by wrapping the information in a special syntax with braces and a pound character.  Here's an example of a link to an article about the #{ link_to "alt attribute's relevance to SEO", "https://econsultancy.com/blog/63845-the-basics-of-using-alt-text-for-seo" }.

p That was a link to a random page on the internet.  If you wanted to link to somewhere within this site, you have a couple options.

p Here is a link to #{ link_to "Schmidt's Lavender and Sage product page", get_product_url(data.products["Schmidt's Lavender & Sage"]) }

p Here is a link to #{ link_to "Schmidt's Lavender and Sage affiliate link", data.products["Schmidt's Lavender & Sage"].affiliate_link }

p Here is a link to #{ link_to "an article on this site", get_post_url("Our review of the best tub deodorants") }

h2 Site Map

p To see every page that is on the website, you can browse the #{ link_to "sitemap", "/__middleman/sitemap/" }

h2 Font styles

p Here is how you can make words bold or italic:  More text with some <strong> words in bold</strong>.  And other <em> words in italic </em>

h2 Emojis

p Emojis are surprisingly easy to incorporate into a website; in fact, it's just as easy as copy and paste. üòç 

p This is because emojis have gained first class status as a part of text.  That means that you aren't really embedding an image into the webpage.  You're actually using a special text code that is rendered as the image.  On the downside, this means that some very old browsers won't render them right and will put a grey box instead.  Luckily, that market is shrinking and in the future full emoji support with be a sure thing üí™.  

p To find emojis, head over to #{ link_to "emojipedia", "http://emojipedia.org/" } or #{ link_to "getemoji", "http://getemoji.com/" }, copy something you like and paste it directly into Atom.

p Here's an emoji twig. So nature! üåø

h2 Markdown

p Up until now we have been using "slim" syntax.  It has a "p" or other tag at the beginning of each line.  Another option is markdown.  It makes some things easier but it also gives you less control of appearance.  I just put it here for the sake of completeness.  Slim is probably a better option.

markdown:
  Here is a simple markdown example: Use **bold** text or *italics*.

  Here is a list using markdown:

    * First item
    * second item
