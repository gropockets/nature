Maverick deoderant is a wonderful new tub-style deoderant.  It has a fresh scent and uses only all-natural ingredients.  If you have tried Schmidt's deoderant or Primal Pit Paste, then you will definitely enjoy Maverick deoderant.READMORE Plus, at $.59 cheaper per ounce, you'll save some cash, too!

Maverick currently only has one scent available but we spoke to their founder and they said they plan to have two additional scents available in time for the summer.
