<h1> hello world, again</h1>

<p> Maverick deoderant is a wonderful new tub-style deoderant.  It has a fresh scent and uses only all-natural ingredients.  If you have tried Schmidt's deoderant or Primal Pit Paste, then you will definitely enjoy Maverick deoderant.READMORE Plus, at $.59 cheaper per ounce, you'll save some cash, too! </p>

<p>Maverick currently only has one scent available but we spoke to their founder and they said they plan to have two additional scents available in time for the summer. </p>
