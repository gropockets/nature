        description: Unique ingredients like activated charcoal, colloidal silver and vodka create a dynamic formula that works wonders.
        bottom_line: The activated charcoal not only absorbs moisture (1000x its own weight!), but also draws toxins from the body. This makes it a great fit for someone wanting to transition to a natural deodorant. Naturally Sourced also includes unique ingredients like colloidal silver - known for its astonishing antibacterial properties and vodka - a natural preservative and another agent to kill and prevent odor causing bacteria. The greyish hue is due to the natural charcoal, but it disappears when rubbed into the skin and doesn’t stain. This formula uses a minimal amount of baking soda to prevent a sensitive skin reaction.
        applicator: None included.

                Primal Pit Paste is fantastic for more vigorous activities at the gym or outdoors. The all natural and mostly organic ingredients eliminate smelly bacteria while still allowing your body to sweat (but not too much). The Florida Mom/CrossFit trainer, Amy Cazin, was determined to create a formula for the whole family...even kids! Her company now handcrafts an extensive line in Austin, Texas. If you’re sensitive to baking soda, they also have “light” less baking soda #{ link_to "options", data.products["Primal Pit Paste Vanilla Lavender Light"].affiliate_link }. The consistency may seem pretty thick, but it goes on clear and absorbs into the skin quickly.
        applicator: Includes a small wooden applicator - like a mini popsicle stick.

        bottom_line: Bentonite Clay a.k.a. “Indian Healing Clay” produces a negative electrical charge when mixed with water that binds to positively charged toxins and heavy metals. Molivera Organics is sodium based - as opposed to  calcium based - and can absorb several times its dry mass while also carrying a higher negative ionic charge.  They produce their clay incredibly fine which makes for a super creamy mask that tightens up and tingles just right. The convenient tub is opaque to avoid sun damage.
